            <p>My name is Samuel Kagwimi Njenga and I am an international student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, at Florida Gulf Coast University.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering" style="color:darkblue;" target="_blank"> Learn more about software engineering</a><br/></p>
            
            <p>I was born and raised in Kenya up until the age of 19, which is when I made plans to study abroad. I learned about Florida Gulf Coast University through my aunt who lives in Fort Myers, the city where the school is located, and after going through the application process I was fortunate enough to be accepted. I was born on the 27th of January 1998  and I have three siblings and both parents present in my life. I was raised by relatively strict christian parents but I made a personal decision to become an active christian in my teen years. Thank you for visiting my page and I hope that as you browse through the pages on this website, that you will be able to learn more about me, my history and current achievements.</p>
